 <h3>How to Prevent Frozen Pipes</h3>

Winter has finally set in, and with it, the cold temperatures that can freeze pipes. Some tips on preventing frozen pipes are as follows:
  
Warm your home, especially in unheated sections, like attics, basements, or garages.
  
Allow faucets to drip when the temperature drops below freezing.
  
Leave the doors of cabinets open so that warm air will flow around pipes, especially in the kitchen and bathroom.
  
  For more winter plumbing tips or to schedule a pipe inspection, call Fast Flushing Plumbing!
